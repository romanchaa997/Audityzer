## Security Researcher / Auditor Outreach

Hi [Name],

I noticed your excellent work on [specific project/contribution/CTF]. 

I've developed Audityzer, a tool that automates fuzz testing for Web3 wallets and bridges. It runs tests that detect vulnerabilities like signature replay and flash loan attacks, saving hours of manual setup.

**Key benefits:**
- Tests across MetaMask, Coinbase, WalletConnect (95%+ compatibility)
- Detects vulnerabilities in Layer 0, Optimism, and other bridge implementations
- Designed for Sherlock and C4 competitive audit targets
- Generates markdown reports with security recommendations

Would you be interested in giving it a quick try? I'd love to hear your feedback and can offer [incentive: early access/free license/bug bounty credits].

Thanks,

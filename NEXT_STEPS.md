# Audityzer - Actionable Next Steps for Project Growth

## üéØ Immediate Actions (Next 24-48 Hours)

### 1. Complete GitHub Authentication & Code Push
**Priority: CRITICAL**

```bash
# Complete the GitHub authentication process
# Use code: B1B6-F042 at https://github.com/login/device

# After authentication, verify and push code
gh auth status
cd /home/ubuntu/Audityzer
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Complete deployment setup and documentation"
git push origin main
```

**Expected Outcome:** All deployment improvements and documentation are version controlled and accessible to the team.

### 2. Set Up Production Environment Variables
**Priority: HIGH**

Create a secure `.env.production` file with real credentials:

```bash
# Copy template and update with real values
cp .env .env.production

# Update these critical values:
# - OPENAI_API_KEY (get from OpenAI dashboard)
# - GITHUB_TOKEN (create personal access token)
# - Database passwords (generate secure passwords)
# - JWT secrets (generate cryptographically secure keys)
# - Slack/Discord webhooks (set up team notifications)
```

### 3. Deploy Full Docker Stack
**Priority: HIGH**

```bash
# Deploy all services with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Verify all services are running
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f audityzer-app

# Test the full stack
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:9090  # Prometheus
curl http://localhost:3001  # Grafana
```

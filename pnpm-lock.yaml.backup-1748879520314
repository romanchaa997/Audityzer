# REMOVED: This file was causing package manager conflicts
# The project now uses npm exclusively as specified in package.json
# Original content backed up in pnpm-lock.yaml.backup
# To restore: rename pnpm-lock.yaml.backup to pnpm-lock.yaml

# This file is intentionally minimal to prevent package manager conflicts
# while preserving the filename for potential future use

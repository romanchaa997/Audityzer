# MetaMask Security Testing Implementation Status

## Current Status

The MetaMask security testing framework has been set up with the following components:

1. **Test Infrastructure**

   - Basic test structure for MetaMask wallet security testing
   - Test files for wallet connection and transaction flows
   - Integration with AI-powered vulnerability detection
   - Fuzzing capabilities for testing MetaMask extension

2. **Mock dApp**

   - Simple mock application for testing wallet connections
   - Support for various MetaMask operations

3. **Test Runner**
   - Script to run all MetaMask security tests in sequence
   - Reporting of test results and potential vulnerabilities

## Current Issues

Several issues have been identified during testing:

1. **Environment Configuration**

   - Playwright configuration needs adjustment for browser extension testing
   - Mock dApp server needs to be running in parallel with tests

2. **Browser Extension Integration**

   - Issues with MetaMask extension loading in Playwright browser

3. **Test Failures**
   - AI model mock implementation for vulnerability detection
   - Fuzzer server and browser integration issues

## Next Steps

To fully implement the MetaMask security testing framework:

1. **Fix Browser Extension Loading**

   - Update Playwright test files to properly load and interact with MetaMask

2. **Improve Mock dApp**

   - Ensure proper server startup and shutdown during tests

3. **Enhance Test Framework**
   - Implement proper mocking for AI vulnerability detection
   - Create more targeted fuzzing tests for specific MetaMask features

## Using the Framework

To use the MetaMask security testing framework:

1. **Setup**

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/Audityzer.git
   cd Audityzer

   # Install dependencies
   npm install

   # Place the MetaMask extension files in extensions/metamask directory
   ```

2. **Running Tests**

   ```bash
   # Start the mock dApp
   cd mocked-sample-app
   npm start

   # In another terminal, run the tests
   $env:MOCK_MODE="true"
   $env:TARGET_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   node scripts/run-metamask-tests.js
   ```

## Feature Branch Workflow

### Creating Feature Branches

```bash
# 1. Update develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/description-of-feature

# 3. Work on feature
# Make changes, commit regularly

# 4. Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/description-of-feature

# 5. Create pull request to develop
```

### Feature Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/bridge-testing-layerzero
feature/ai-vulnerability-detection
feature/dashboard-real-time-updates
feature/community-discord-integration
feature/marketing-automation-twitter
```

### Feature Branch Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Branch from `develop`
2. **Development**: Regular commits with descriptive messages
3. **Testing**: Local testing and CI/CD validation
4. **Review**: Code review and feedback incorporation
5. **Merge**: Merge to `develop` after approval
6. **Cleanup**: Delete feature branch after merge

## Release Workflow

### Regular Release Process

```bash
# 1. Merge develop to roadmap-exec
git checkout roadmap-exec
git merge develop

# 2. Merge roadmap-exec to safe-improvements
git checkout safe-improvements
git merge roadmap-exec

# 3. Merge safe-improvements to unified-main
git checkout unified-main
git merge safe-improvements

# 4. Create release candidate
git checkout -b release/v1.3.0
# Update version numbers, changelog

# 5. Merge to main after testing
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.3.0
git tag v1.3.0
```

### Hotfix Process

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-fix

# 2. Implement fix
# Make necessary changes

# 3. Test thoroughly
npm test
npm run test:security

# 4. Merge to main and develop
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-security-fix
git tag v1.2.1

git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/critical-security-fix
```

## Merge Strategies

### Fast-Forward Merges
- Used for: Simple feature additions
- Requirement: Linear history
- Command: `git merge --ff-only`

### Merge Commits
- Used for: Feature branches with multiple commits
- Requirement: Preserve feature branch history
- Command: `git merge --no-ff`

### Squash Merges
- Used for: Cleaning up commit history
- Requirement: Single logical change
- Command: `git merge --squash`

### Rebase and Merge
- Used for: Clean linear history
- Requirement: No conflicts
- Command: `git rebase` then `git merge --ff-only`

## Branch Protection Rules

## Automation and Tools

### Automated Branch Management

```javascript
// scripts/branch-automation.js
const { Octokit } = require('@octokit/rest');

class BranchManager {
  constructor(token) {
    this.octokit = new Octokit({ auth: token });
  }

  async setupBranchProtection(owner, repo, branch, rules) {
    await this.octokit.repos.updateBranchProtection({
      owner,
      repo,
      branch,
      ...rules
    });
  }

  async autoMergeToUpstream(sourceBranch, targetBranch) {
    // Automated merge logic
    const { data: pr } = await this.octokit.pulls.create({
      owner: 'Audityzer',
      repo: 'audityzer',
      title: `Auto-merge ${sourceBranch} to ${targetBranch}`,
      head: sourceBranch,
      base: targetBranch,
      body: 'Automated merge from CI/CD pipeline'
    });

    return pr;
  }
}
```

### Branch Synchronization

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/sync-branches.sh

# Sync develop with feature branches
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Merge develop to roadmap-exec
git checkout roadmap-exec
git merge develop --no-ff -m "Sync develop to roadmap-exec"

# Merge roadmap-exec to safe-improvements (if stable)
if [ "$STABILITY_CHECK" = "passed" ]; then
  git checkout safe-improvements
  git merge roadmap-exec --no-ff -m "Sync roadmap-exec to safe-improvements"
fi

# Push all branches
git push origin develop roadmap-exec safe-improvements
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Branch Health Metrics

```javascript
// monitoring/branch-metrics.js
const metrics = {
  branchAge: {
    develop: calculateBranchAge('develop'),
    roadmapExec: calculateBranchAge('roadmap-exec'),
    safeImprovements: calculateBranchAge('safe-improvements')
  },
  
  mergeFrequency: {
    daily: getMergeCount('1d'),
    weekly: getMergeCount('7d'),
    monthly: getMergeCount('30d')
  },
  
  conflictRate: {
    develop: getConflictRate('develop'),
    roadmapExec: getConflictRate('roadmap-exec')
  },
  
  testCoverage: {
    main: getTestCoverage('main'),
    unifiedMain: getTestCoverage('unified-main'),
    develop: getTestCoverage('develop')
  }
};
```

### Alerting Rules

```yaml
# monitoring/branch-alerts.yml
alerts:
  - name: StaleFeatureBranch
    condition: branch_age > 30d AND branch_type = "feature"
    severity: warning
    action: notify_author

  - name: HighConflictRate
    condition: conflict_rate > 0.3
    severity: critical
    action: notify_maintainers

  - name: LowTestCoverage
    condition: test_coverage < 0.8
    severity: warning
    action: block_merge

  - name: SecurityVulnerability
    condition: security_scan = "failed"
    severity: critical
    action: block_merge
```

3. **Ensure quality gates are met**
4. **Maintain branch protection rules**
5. **Monitor branch health metrics**
6. **Coordinate releases effectively**

### For Release Management

1. **Plan releases in advance**
2. **Communicate changes clearly**
3. **Test thoroughly before release**
4. **Document breaking changes**
5. **Maintain backward compatibility**
6. **Coordinate with community**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Merge Conflicts
```bash
# Resolve conflicts manually
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase develop
# Resolve conflicts in editor
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

#### Failed CI/CD Checks
```bash
# Run tests locally
npm test
npm run test:security
npm run lint

# Fix issues and push
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve CI/CD issues"
git push
```

#### Branch Protection Violations
```bash
# Check protection rules
gh api repos/Audityzer/audityzer/branches/main/protection

# Request review bypass (maintainers only)
gh pr review --approve
```

## Migration Guide

### Updating Existing Branches

```bash
# Update local repository
git fetch --all --prune

# Checkout and update each branch
for branch in main unified-main safe-improvements roadmap-exec develop; do
  git checkout $branch
  git pull origin $branch
done

# Update branch protection rules
npm run setup:branch-protection
```

### Legacy Branch Cleanup

```bash
# List merged branches
git branch --merged main

# Delete merged feature branches
git branch --merged main | grep "feature/" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d

# Clean up remote tracking branches
git remote prune origin
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Automated Release Notes**: Generate release notes from commit messages
2. **Smart Merge Suggestions**: AI-powered merge conflict resolution
3. **Branch Health Dashboard**: Real-time branch metrics visualization
4. **Automated Testing**: Enhanced CI/CD with more comprehensive tests
5. **Community Integration**: Better integration with Discord and forums

### Experimental Features

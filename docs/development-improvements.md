# Development Environment Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the Web3 Security Test Kit development environment.

## Overview of Changes

We've implemented several key improvements to streamline the development workflow and make it easier to set up, run, and manage the development environment:

1. **PowerShell Server Manager Script** - A robust script to start, stop, and restart the development server
2. **Batch Files for Easy Access** - Simple batch files for non-technical users to start and stop the server
3. **Enhanced Package.json Scripts** - New npm scripts for improved development workflow
4. **Windows Setup Script** - Automated setup for Windows environments
5. **Interactive Web Interface** - Improved UI for the audit test page
6. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Detailed setup and usage instructions

## PowerShell Server Manager

The `server-manager.ps1` script provides a powerful way to manage the development server:

- Start the server on any port
- Stop the server gracefully
- Restart the server when needed
- Open the browser automatically

### Usage

```powershell
.\scripts\server-manager.ps1 -Action start -Port 5000
.\scripts\server-manager.ps1 -Action stop -Port 5000
.\scripts\server-manager.ps1 -Action restart -Port 5000
```

## Batch Files for Easy Access

For users who prefer not to use PowerShell directly, we've added simple batch files:

- `start-server.bat` - Starts the development server
- `stop-server.bat` - Stops the development server

These files require no command-line knowledge and work directly from Windows Explorer.

## Enhanced Package.json Scripts

New npm scripts have been added to improve the development workflow:

```json
"dev:serve": "serve -p 5000",
"stop:serve": "node -e \"require('child_process').exec('powershell -Command \\\"Stop-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5000).OwningProcess -Force\\\"')\""
```

These scripts make it easy to start and stop the server using npm commands.

## Windows Setup Script

The `setup-windows.ps1` script automates the setup of the development environment on Windows:

- Checks for Node.js and npm installation
- Installs project dependencies
- Creates necessary configuration files
- Sets up the Firebase configuration
- Provides clear instructions for next steps

## Interactive Web Interface

The audit test page has been enhanced with a modern, interactive interface:

- Clean, responsive design
- Interactive test dashboard
- Real-time test console output
- Progress tracking
- Test result metrics
- Mock wallet integration for testing

## Dependency Management

We've resolved dependency conflicts and simplified the installation process:

- Fixed mermaid-cli and puppeteer version conflicts
- Added serve as a dev dependency
- Updated documentation with installation troubleshooting

## Documentation

We've added comprehensive documentation to make it easier to get started:

- `docs/development-setup.md` - Detailed setup instructions
- `docs/development-improvements.md` - Summary of improvements
- Updated README.md with new development workflow information

## Future Improvements

Moving forward, we recommend the following additional improvements:

1. **Cross-Platform Setup Scripts** - Add setup scripts for Linux and macOS
2. **Docker Development Environment** - Create a Dockerized development environment
3. **Configuration UI** - Add a graphical interface for managing configuration
4. **Testing Workflow Automation** - Further automate the testing workflow
5. **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements** - Improve the GitHub Actions workflow

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance the development experience for the Web3 Security Test Kit. The automated setup, server management tools, and improved documentation make it easier for developers to get started and be productive.

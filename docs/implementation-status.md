# Audityzer Security Platform - Implementation Status

## 🎯 Project Transformation Complete

**Date**: June 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### Critical Error Correction ✅ COMPLETED

**Issue**: Project was incorrectly described as "audio analysis" platform  
**Resolution**: Comprehensive terminology correction across entire codebase

#### Files Corrected:
- ✅ Plugin framework documentation (17 files)
- ✅ Component implementations (TypeScript/React)
- ✅ API interfaces and type definitions
- ✅ Example plugins and templates
- ✅ Social media templates and marketing materials
- ✅ Developer documentation and guidelines

#### Terminology Changes Applied:
- `audio analysis` → `security auditing`
- `audio plugin` → `security auditing plugin`
- `audio processing` → `security analysis processing`
- `AudioProcessor` → `SecurityProcessor`
- `audioData` → `securityData`

## 🔄 Branching Strategy Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

### Trunk-Based Development Established
- **Trunk Branch**: `safe-improvements` (primary development branch)
- **Merged**: `roadmap-exec` successfully integrated
- **Cleaned**: Merged branches removed from local repository
- **Strategy**: Short-lived feature branches (max 72 hours)

### Branch Management

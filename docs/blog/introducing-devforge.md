Today, I'm excited to announce the release of **Audityzer**, an intelligent development server specifically designed for Web3 security testing. If you've ever struggled with port conflicts, server monitoring, or cross-platform compatibility while testing Web3 applications, Audityzer was built to solve these exact pain points.

## The Problem

As Web3 security researchers, we often run into a common set of frustrating issues when testing decentralized applications:

- Port conflicts between services like Hardhat, Ganache, and our application servers
- Lack of visibility into server health during automated testing
- Inconsistent process management across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Missing health endpoints for monitoring during complex security tests

These might seem like small issues individually, but they compound to slow down security testing workflows significantly. And when you're investigating time-sensitive vulnerabilities, these minutes matter.

## Enter Audityzer

Audityzer is a cross-platform development server built with Web3 security testing as its primary focus. Here's what makes it different:

### Automatic Port Management

No more `EADDRINUSE` errors. Audityzer automatically finds an available port if your preferred one is occupied:

```bash
# When port 5050 is already in use
$ audityzer start -p 5050

Finding available port starting from 5050...
Port 5050 is already in use, trying 5051...
Port 5051 is already in use, trying 5052...
Server started with PID: 10428 on port 5052
```

### Built-in Health Endpoints

Every server comes with a health API endpoint that provides detailed metadata:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:5053/health

{
  "status": "running",
  "uptime": 125.4,
  "pid": 12345,
  "port": 5052,
  "memory": "24.8MB",
  "os": "windows",
  "node": "v16.14.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-13T03:05:48.000Z"
}
```

This is invaluable when you're running complex test suites and need to know exactly what's happening with your server.

### Cross-Platform Support

Audityzer works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux. We've thoroughly tested process management, path handling, and port detection on all three platforms to ensure a smooth experience regardless of your development environment.

### Simple API

Audityzer can be used both from the command line and programmatically:

```javascript
const audityzer = require('audityzer');

// Start a server
audityzer.start({
  port: 5050,
  directory: './public'
});

// Get server status
const status = audityzer.getStatus();
console.log(status);

// Stop server
audityzer.stop();
```

## Web3 Security Testing Use Cases

Here are a few ways Audityzer is helping security researchers:

1. **Running multiple test environments** - Test against different chains and configurations simultaneously without port conflicts
2. **CI/CD integration** - Reliable server management in continuous integration environments
3. **Monitoring transaction behavior** - The health endpoint provides valuable data during security tests
4. **Cross-chain testing** - Test bridge vulnerabilities with consistent server behavior across different test environments

## Getting Started

Installation is simple:

```bash
# Global installation
npm install -g audityzer

# Project installation
npm install --save-dev audityzer
```

Basic usage:

```bash
# Start a server
audityzer start

# Check status
audityzer status

# Stop server
audityzer stop
```

## Open Source & Community Driven

Audityzer is fully open source under the MIT license. We're actively seeking contributions, bug reports, feature requests, and general feedback from the Web3 security community.

Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/YourUser/audityzer) to get involved!

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning for Audityzer. Our roadmap includes:

1. VS Code extension for server management
2. Integration with popular Web3 testing frameworks
3. Enhanced monitoring capabilities specifically for blockchain interactions
4. Remote monitoring dashboard

We're committed to making Web3 security testing more efficient and less frustrating. If you have ideas or feature requests, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.

Happy testing!

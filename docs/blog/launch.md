> Audityzer is an intelligent development server built for modern Web3 security testing workflows. Today we are thrilled to release **v1.0.0**.

## Why Audityzer?

Traditional dev-servers make you babysit ports, SSL, and build steps. Audityzer automates all of that and adds security-first instrumentation: smart port allocation, integrated Playwright & Lighthouse drivers, and first-class support for EVM tool-chains.

## Key Features

- ⚡ **One-command start**: `npx audityzer dev` starts a ready-to-hack environment.
- 🛡️ **Security tests on save**: vulnerability suites run automatically.
- 🌐 **Cross-platform**: works on Windows, macOS, Linux & Docker.
- 📈 **Lighthouse CI**: built-in Lighthouse regression.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install --global audityzer

# Launch demo project
npx audityzer dev
```

## What's next

In the coming weeks we will roll out:

1. Plug-in marketplace
2. zkApps template pack
3. Community dashboards

## Thank you!

This release would not be possible without our amazing contributors and early testers. Join us on GitHub Sponsors to shape the future of secure development.

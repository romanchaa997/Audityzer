# Audityzer Architecture

## Overview

Audityzer is an intelligent security testing framework for Web3 applications and smart contracts. It provides automated testing, vulnerability detection, and reporting capabilities.

```

## Workflow

1. **Configuration**: The system is configured using a JSON configuration file validated against a schema.
2. **Test Generation**: Tests can be generated manually or using AI assistance.
3. **Test Execution**: Tests are executed using Playwright against the target dApp.
4. **Security Analysis**: Smart contracts are analyzed for vulnerabilities.
5. **Reporting**: Results are compiled into comprehensive reports.
6. **CI Integration**: Tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Features

### AI-Assisted Test Generation

Audityzer uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate tests based on natural language descriptions of vulnerabilities or test scenarios.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>CLI: Ask to generate test
    CLI->>OpenAI: Send prompt
    OpenAI->>CLI: Return generated test
    CLI->>FileSystem: Save test file
    CLI->>User: Confirm test creation
```

### Security Testing

The security testing workflow involves multiple components working together:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>CLI: Run security test
    CLI->>Fuzzer: Fuzz wallet flows
    Fuzzer->>dApp: Interact with dApp
    dApp->>Fuzzer: Return results
    CLI->>SecurityChecker: Check for vulnerabilities
    SecurityChecker->>Blockchain: Analyze contracts
    Blockchain->>SecurityChecker: Return data
    SecurityChecker->>CLI: Return vulnerabilities
    CLI->>Reporter: Generate report
    Reporter->>User: Present findings
```

### CI/CD Integration

Audityzer can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Developer->>GitHub: Push code
    GitHub->>Actions: Trigger workflow
    Actions->>Audityzer: Run tests
    Audityzer->>dApp: Test for vulnerabilities
    Audityzer->>Actions: Return results
    Actions->>GitHub: Update PR status
    GitHub->>Developer: Show test results
```

    Results --> Analysis[Security Analysis]
    Analysis --> Report[Report Generation]
    Report --> Output[Output Formats]
```

## Deployment

Audityzer can be deployed in various environments:

1. **Local Development**: Run directly on a developer's machine
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrated into continuous integration workflows
3. **Security Audit**: Used by security teams for vulnerability assessments
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Deployed for ongoing security monitoring

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced AI Models**: Integration with more specialized AI models for security
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of deployed contracts
- **Expanded Vulnerability Database**: More comprehensive vulnerability detection
- **Automated Remediation**: Suggestions for fixing detected vulnerabilities
- **Cross-chain Support**: Expanded support for multiple blockchains

# Audityzer Branching Strategy - Trunk-Based Development

## Overview
Audityzer implements a trunk-based development workflow optimized for security auditing and fuzzing tool development. This strategy accelerates integration cycles, reduces branch management overhead, and maintains high code quality for our security-focused platform.

## Core Principles

### 1. Trunk-Based Development
- **Main Branch**: `safe-improvements` serves as our trunk and source of truth
- **Short-lived Feature Branches**: Maximum 2-3 days before integration
- **Rapid Integration**: Multiple daily integrations to maintain development velocity
- **Continuous Testing**: Automated security scanning and testing on all branches

### 2. Security-First Approach
- All branches undergo automated security analysis
- Vulnerability scanning before merge approval
- Fuzzing tests for security plugin integrations
- Code quality gates focused on security best practices

## Branch Types

### Trunk Branch: `safe-improvements`
- Primary development branch for security auditing features
- Always deployable and production-ready
- Receives all feature branch merges
- Protected with automated quality gates

### Feature Branches
- **Naming Convention**: `feature/security-[component]-[description]`
- **Examples**: 
  - `feature/security-plugin-framework`
  - `feature/security-vulnerability-scanner`
  - `feature/security-fuzzing-engine`
- **Lifecycle**: Create → Develop → Test → Merge → Delete
- **Maximum Duration**: 72 hours

### Integration Branches (Temporary)
- `feature/community-portal` - Community engagement for security researchers
- `feature/marketing-automation` - Outreach for security auditing bounty program
- These will be integrated sequentially into trunk

## Workflow Process

### 1. Feature Development
```bash
# Create feature branch from trunk
git checkout safe-improvements
git pull origin safe-improvements
git checkout -b feature/security-new-scanner

# Develop with frequent commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement vulnerability detection engine"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/security-new-scanner
```

### 2. Integration Process
- Automated CI/CD pipeline triggers on push
- Security scanning (SAST, dependency check)
- Automated testing of security plugins
- Code review focusing on security implications
- Merge to trunk upon approval

### 3. Automated Cleanup
- Merged branches automatically deleted
- Stale branch identification after 7 days
- Local branch pruning recommendations

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Merge Requirements
1. **Security Scan**: No high/critical vulnerabilities
2. **Plugin Tests**: All security plugin tests pass
3. **Fuzzing Tests**: Basic fuzzing validation
4. **Code Review**: Security-focused peer review
5. **Documentation**: Security implications documented

### Automated Checks
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Security plugin compatibility tests
- Performance impact assessment

## Release Management

### Release Branches
- Created from trunk for version releases
- **Naming**: `release/v[major].[minor].[patch]`
- **Purpose**: Final testing and production deployment
- **Lifecycle**: 24-48 hours maximum

### Hotfix Process
- Critical security fixes bypass normal workflow
- Direct commits to trunk with immediate deployment
- Post-deployment validation and documentation

## Branch Protection Rules

### Trunk Protection (`safe-improvements`)
- Require pull request reviews (minimum 1)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict pushes to administrators only
- Require signed commits for security

### Feature Branch Guidelines
- Regular rebasing against trunk
- Atomic commits with clear security context
- Comprehensive testing before PR creation

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Current State (Complete)
- ✅ Merged `roadmap-exec` into `safe-improvements`
- ✅ Established trunk-based workflow
- ✅ Updated documentation for security focus

### Phase 2: Integration (In Progress)
- Integrate `feature/community-portal`
- Integrate `feature/marketing-automation`
- Archive legacy branches

### Phase 3: Optimization
- Implement advanced automated testing
- Enhanced security scanning pipeline
- Performance monitoring integration

## Best Practices

### For Security Plugin Development
1. **Isolated Testing**: Test security plugins in sandboxed environments
2. **Vulnerability Disclosure**: Follow responsible disclosure for discovered issues
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive security impact documentation
4. **Validation**: Multi-stage validation for security tools

### For Contributors
1. **Small Commits**: Atomic changes for easier security review
2. **Clear Messages**: Commit messages indicating security implications
3. **Regular Sync**: Daily synchronization with trunk
4. **Testing**: Local security testing before push

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Development Velocity
- Average feature branch lifetime
- Integration frequency
- Time to production deployment

### Security Metrics
- Vulnerability detection rate
- False positive reduction
- Security plugin effectiveness
- Code quality improvements

## Tools and Automation

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Security scanning integration
- Automated branch cleanup
- Performance monitoring

### Local Development
- Pre-commit hooks for security checks
- Local fuzzing test capabilities
- Automated dependency updates

This branching strategy ensures rapid development of security auditing capabilities while maintaining the highest standards of code quality and security for the Audityzer platform.

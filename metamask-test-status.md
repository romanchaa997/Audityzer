# MetaMask Security Testing Status

## Implementation Status

- Created test files for MetaMask wallet connection testing
- Created test files for MetaMask transaction flow testing
- Set up AI-based vulnerability detection framework
- Created fuzzing infrastructure for MetaMask extension testing
- Implemented a mock dApp for testing MetaMask connections

## Current Issues

- Playwright browser is having trouble loading the MetaMask extension
- Mock dApp server needs to be properly started during tests
- AI model integration needs mocking for consistent test execution
- Test execution environment variable configuration needs clarification

## Next Steps

1. Fix browser extension loading issues in Playwright
2. Implement proper server startup for mock dApp
3. Create better mocking for AI vulnerability detection
4. Improve fuzzing capabilities with targeted tests
5. Document setup and usage procedures

## Usage Instructions

```bash
# Start the mock dApp server
cd mocked-sample-app
npm start

# In another terminal, run the tests
$env:MOCK_MODE="true"
$env:TARGET_URL="http://localhost:3000"
node scripts/run-metamask-tests.js
```

"test:l2-bridge": "npx playwright test src/core/bridge-testing/l2-bridge-security-test.ts",
"test:bridge-security": "node src/index.js test-bridge-security",
"submit:immunefi:batch": "node src/core/bounty-integration/immunefi-cli.js batch-submit --input=reports/findings.json",
"analyze:vulnerabilities": "node src/index.js analyze-vulnerabilities --enhance --classify",
"generate:bounty-report": "node src/core/bounty-integration/immunefi-submission-generator.js --from-findings=reports/findings.json --output=reports/bounty-report",
"test:bridge-arbitrum": "node src/index.js test-bridge --network=arbitrum --contract=0x1234567890abcdef --report",
"test:bridge-optimism": "node src/index.js test-bridge --network=optimism --contract=0x1234567890abcdef --report",
"test:bridge-zksync": "node src/index.js test-bridge --network=zksync --contract=0x1234567890abcdef --report"
```

## Usage Examples

### Running Enhanced Visualization Reports

```bash
npm run security-scan:enhanced
npm run report:enhanced
```

### Testing Layer 2 Bridge Security

```bash
npm run test:bridge-arbitrum
npm run test:bridge-optimism
npm run test:bridge-zksync
```

### Immunefi Bounty Submission

```bash
npm run submit:immunefi:batch
npm run generate:bounty-report
```

### Using Enhanced Wallet Security Testing

```bash
# Test with Coinbase Wallet security checks
npx playwright test --project=coinbase

# Test with Phantom Wallet (Solana) security checks
npx playwright test --project=phantom
```

## Conclusion

These enhancements significantly improve the Audityzer's capabilities for detecting vulnerabilities in Web3 applications, with a focus on wallet security, Layer 2 bridge vulnerabilities, comprehensive visualization, and bounty platform integration. The implementation follows best practices for security testing and provides detailed reporting for security teams.

## Quick Start Guide for Documentation Site

We've fixed the issues that were preventing the documentation site from working. Follow these steps to test and deploy the site:

### 1. Run Locally (Test Fix)

```powershell
cd docs-site
npm install react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0 --legacy-peer-deps
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm start
```

This should now successfully start the documentation site locally without errors.

### 2. Deploy to GitHub Pages

Once you've verified the site works locally, deploy it using:

```powershell
.\deploy-docs.ps1
```

The updated deployment script handles:
- Installing dependencies with compatibility flags
- Updating React to the correct version
- Removing the broken GIF reference
- Deploying to GitHub Pages

### 3. Future Improvements

1. Add a proper screenshot or GIF to the quickstart page
2. Complete any missing documentation sections
3. Set up the custom domain by configuring DNS settings

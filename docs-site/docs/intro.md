# Introduction to Web3FuzzForge

Web3FuzzForge is an automated test scaffolding tool for battle-tested Web3 developers who need efficient security testing solutions.

## Why This Tool Exists

Every decent web3 project has smart contract tests. Few have UI tests. That's a security nightmare.

This tool generates test templates that automate the previously unautomatable:

- MetaMask interactions
- Wallet connections
- Transaction signing
- Network switching

All through programmable interfaces that make testing Web3 applications significantly easier.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Wallet Support**: Test with MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, and more.
- **Type Generation**: JavaScript and TypeScript support for all templates.
- **Preset Configurations**: Pre-configured settings for ERC20/721, DeFi, DAO applications.
- **AI-Driven Configuration**: Generate configs using natural language prompts.
- **Wallet State Snapshots**: Save and restore wallet states for complex test scenarios.
- **Security Test Templates**: Pre-built templates for common security test patterns.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Track and optimize test performance.

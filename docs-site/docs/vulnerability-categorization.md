# Vulnerability Categorization

This page provides a standardized approach to categorizing Web3 security vulnerabilities discovered in your tests.

## Web3 Vulnerability Classification System

Audityzer is working toward a comprehensive vulnerability classification system specifically designed for Web3 applications, combining elements from established frameworks like OWASP Top 10 with blockchain-specific vulnerability categories.

### Current Categories

Our current vulnerability classification includes:

#### 1. Wallet Connection Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability ID | Name                        | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WC-001           | Insecure Connection Request | Wallet connection requests without proper origin verification |
| WC-002           | Connection Spoofing         | Fake wallet connection UI that harvests private data          |
| WC-003           | Missing Disconnect Handler  | Application fails to handle wallet disconnection properly     |
| WC-004           | Connection State Leakage    | Sensitive connection data exposed to unauthorized domains     |

#### 2. Transaction Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability ID | Name                           | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| TX-001           | Gas Manipulation               | Manipulating gas parameters to user's disadvantage  |
| TX-002           | Transaction Value Tampering    | Modifying transaction amount without user consent   |
| TX-003           | Transaction Replay             | Same transaction can be submitted multiple times    |
| TX-004           | Recipient Address Manipulation | Modifying recipient address during transaction flow |

#### 3. Signature Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability ID | Name                        | Description                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SG-001           | Signature Replay            | Signatures can be reused in different contexts   |
| SG-002           | Unsigned Data Injection     | Critical parameters not covered by the signature |
| SG-003           | Malformed Signature Request | Signature request with misleading information    |
| SG-004           | Missing EIP-712 Typehash    | Signatures without proper typed data structure   |

#### 4. State Management Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability ID | Name                      | Description                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SM-001           | Wallet State Confusion    | Application confusion about wallet state (connected/disconnected) |
| SM-002           | Network Mismatch          | Application operating on different network than wallet            |
| SM-003           | Account Switching Failure | Application fails to handle account switching properly            |
| SM-004           | Chain ID Spoofing         | Application fails to verify chain ID properly                     |

## Severity Levels

Each vulnerability is assigned a severity level:

- **Critical**: Direct loss of funds or complete compromise of user security
- **High**: Significant security impact with potential for financial loss
- **Medium**: Security weakness that poses partial vulnerability
- **Low**: Minor security issues with limited impact
- **Informational**: No direct security impact, but may affect usability or implementation quality

## Reporting Format

When reporting vulnerabilities, we recommend using this structure:

```
## [Vulnerability ID] - [Vulnerability Name]

**Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low/Informational]

**Description**:
Brief description of the vulnerability.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

**Impact**:
Description of the potential impact.

**Recommendation**:
Suggested fixes or mitigations.

**References**:
Any relevant links or resources.
```

## Contributing to the Classification System

We welcome contributions to our vulnerability classification system:

1. Submit new vulnerability types via GitHub issues
2. Provide real-world examples of vulnerabilities
3. Suggest improvements to existing categories
4. Share test cases that can identify specific vulnerabilities

### Upcoming Improvements

In future releases, we plan to:

1. Integrate with standardized Web3 security frameworks
2. Provide automated vulnerability detection based on test results
3. Create a public database of Web3 security vulnerabilities with examples
4. Integrate with security scanners and analysis tools

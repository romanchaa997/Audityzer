# Next Steps for Web3FuzzForge Documentation

Now that you have set up the basic documentation structure, here are the next steps to complete your documentation hub:

## 1. Fixed Issues

We've resolved several issues:
- Fixed the sidebar reference to the missing "security-testing" document
- Created a PowerShell deployment script for Windows users
- Updated React dependencies to be compatible with Docusaurus v3
- Removed the broken GIF reference from the quickstart page

## 2. Test the Documentation Site Locally

```bash
cd docs-site
npm install react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0 --legacy-peer-deps
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm start
```

## 3. Deploy the Documentation Site

To deploy the documentation site to GitHub Pages, you need to update the deploy script.

### Option 1: Fix SSH Authentication

1. Ensure you have an SSH key generated and added to your GitHub account
2. Test your SSH connection: `ssh -T git@github.com`
3. Make sure the repository exists at `github.com:web3fuzzforge/web3-security-test-kit.git`

### Option 2: Use HTTPS Instead of SSH

Modify the deploy script to use HTTPS authentication:

```powershell
$env:USE_SSH = "false"
$env:GIT_USER = "your-github-username"
# You'll be prompted for your password or personal access token
```

### Option 3: Manual Deployment

If the automatic deployment is challenging, you can deploy manually:

1. Build the site: `npm run build`
2. Copy the contents of the `build` folder
3. Create/switch to the gh-pages branch in your repository
4. Paste the contents and commit
5. Push to GitHub

The documentation site itself is working great now. You just need to resolve this GitHub authentication issue to complete the deployment.

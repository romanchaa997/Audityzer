npm install

# Set up security development environment
npm run setup:security

# Run initial security scan
npm run scan:demo
```

### Basic Security Scanning
```bash

# - static-analyzer: Analyze code for security issues
# - dynamic-tester: Runtime security testing
# - compliance-checker: Security compliance validation
```

### Security Plugin Example
```typescript
import { SecurityPlugin, VulnerabilityScanner } from '@audityzer/security-framework';

export class SQLInjectionScanner extends VulnerabilityScanner {
  name = 'advanced-sql-injection-scanner';
  version = '1.0.0';
  description = 'Advanced SQL injection vulnerability detection with AI analysis';

  async scan(target: WebTarget): Promise<VulnerabilityReport> {
    const vulnerabilities = await this.detectSQLInjection(target);
    return {
      target: target.url,
      vulnerabilities,
      riskLevel: this.calculateRisk(vulnerabilities),
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(vulnerabilities)
    };
  }

  private async detectSQLInjection(target: WebTarget): Promise<Vulnerability[]> {
    // Advanced SQL injection detection logic
    // AI-powered payload generation and analysis
    // Comprehensive vulnerability validation
  }
}
```

![Web3FuzzForge Test Kit](media/metamask-transaction-test.png)

A comprehensive toolkit for testing Web3 dApps, focusing on security and functional testing.

ðŸ“š **[Full Documentation](https://docs.web3fuzzforge.dev)** - Visit our comprehensive documentation site for guides, tutorials, and reference materials.

## Key Features

- **ðŸ¦Š Multi-Wallet Support** - Test with MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase, Phantom, and more
- **ðŸ”’ Security Testing** - Detect vulnerabilities with pre-built security test patterns
- **âš¡ Automated Testing** - Generate tests with a single command
- **ðŸ’¾ Wallet Snapshots** - Save and restore wallet states for complex test scenarios
- **ðŸ§© TypeScript Support** - Full TypeScript compatibility for all templates
- **ðŸŽ­ Playwright Integration** - Built on the powerful Playwright testing framework

## Quick Demo

Run a sample test connecting MetaMask to Uniswap:

```bash
# Install dependencies and Playwright browsers
npm install
npx playwright install

# Run the sample test in headed mode (shows browser)
npx playwright test tests/sample-metamask-connect.test.js --headed
```

## Security Features

This project includes enhanced security features to protect your Web3 testing environment:

- **Dependency Vulnerability Mitigation** - Hardened dependencies with version pinning
- **Dappeteer Security Wrapper** - Enhanced wallet automation with security checks
- **Secure by Default** - Enforces secure connection URLs and provides extra validation

To update security features, run:

```bash
# Check and fix security issues
npm run security:fix

# Update dependencies safely
node package-security-update.js
```

See [SECURITY.md](src/utils/SECURITY.md) for more details on our security strategy.

## Security Enhancements

This project includes several security enhancements:

1. **Custom Wallet Automation**:
   - A secure custom implementation that replaces @chainsafe/dappeteer
   - Built directly on Playwright without vulnerable dependencies
   - Full API compatibility with dappeteer for easy migration

2. **CI/CD Security Integration**:
   - Automated security scanning in GitHub workflows
   - Daily vulnerability checks with issue creation for critical findings
   - Dependency monitoring for new security advisories

3. **Dependency Monitoring**:
   - Dependabot configuration for automated security updates
   - Scheduled scanning of npm dependencies
   - Custom checks for critical Web3 dependencies

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd web3-security-test-kit

# Install dependencies and set up the environment
npm run setup
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests with the custom wallet implementation
npm run security:run-test:custom

# Run security checks
npm run security:scan
```

## Migration from Dappeteer

The project provides a smooth migration path from @chainsafe/dappeteer:

1. Start with the wrapper: `require('../src/utils/dappeteer-wrapper')`
2. Test with the custom implementation: `require('../src/utils/custom-wallet-automation')`
3. After validating, remove the dappeteer dependency

## New Features

### Interactive Setup

Web3FuzzForge now includes an interactive setup wizard to help you get started quickly:

```bash
npx web3fuzzforge init --interactive
```

This will:
- Automatically detect your project type (React, Vue, Hardhat, etc.)
- Guide you through configuring your testing environment
- Suggest appropriate templates based on your project
- Create a customized configuration file

### Improved Error Handling

We've significantly improved error messages and troubleshooting with:
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Specific solutions for common issues
- Automatic dependency checking
- Graceful degradation for missing components

Try the new doctor command to diagnose issues:

```bash
npx web3fuzzforge doctor
```

Or use with the `--fix` flag to automatically fix common problems:

```bash
npx web3fuzzforge doctor --fix
```

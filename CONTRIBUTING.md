# Contributing to Audityzer - Security Auditing Platform

Welcome to Audityzer, a comprehensive security auditing, analyzing, and fuzzing platform! We're building the next generation of security testing tools and welcome contributions from security researchers, developers, and auditing professionals.

## üîí Project Focus: Security Auditing & Fuzzing

Audityzer is a **security auditing platform** that provides:
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Advanced scanning and analysis tools
- **Security Fuzzing**: Comprehensive fuzzing frameworks for security testing
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible security auditing plugin system
- **Automated Analysis**: AI-powered security analysis and reporting
- **Community Bounty Program**: Rewards for security plugin development

## üöÄ Quick Start for Security Contributors

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ for plugin development
- Python 3.8+ for security analysis tools
- Docker for containerized security testing
- Git with signed commits enabled

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/audityzer.git
cd audityzer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up security development environment
npm run setup:security-dev

# Run security plugin tests
npm run test:security
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Plugin Development

### Plugin Types
1. **Vulnerability Scanners**: Detect security weaknesses in applications
2. **Fuzzing Engines**: Generate test cases for security testing
3. **Analysis Tools**: Static and dynamic security analysis
4. **Reporting Modules**: Security audit report generation
5. **Integration Plugins**: Connect with security tools and platforms

### Creating a Security Plugin
```bash
# Generate new security plugin template
npm run create:security-plugin --name=vulnerability-scanner

# Plugin structure
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scanners/          # Vulnerability detection logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fuzzers/          # Fuzzing implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analyzers/        # Security analysis tools
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reporters/        # Security report generators
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/           # Security-focused test suites
```

### Security Plugin API
```typescript
interface SecurityPlugin {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  type: 'scanner' | 'fuzzer' | 'analyzer' | 'reporter';
  
  // Core security functions
  scan(target: SecurityTarget): Promise<VulnerabilityReport>;
  fuzz(target: FuzzTarget): Promise<FuzzResults>;
  analyze(data: SecurityData): Promise<AnalysisReport>;
}
```

## üåü Contribution Workflow

### Trunk-Based Development
We use a trunk-based development workflow optimized for security development:

1. **Main Branch**: `safe-improvements` (our trunk)
2. **Feature Branches**: Short-lived (max 72 hours)
3. **Security Focus**: All contributions undergo security review

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Create Feature Branch
```bash
# Always start from trunk
git checkout safe-improvements
git pull origin safe-improvements

# Create security-focused feature branch
git checkout -b feature/security-[component]-[description]
# Examples:
# feature/security-plugin-sql-injection-scanner
# feature/security-fuzzer-web-api
# feature/security-analyzer-dependency-check
```

#### 2. Develop Security Features
- **Atomic Commits**: Small, focused changes
- **Security Context**: Clear security implications in commit messages
- **Testing**: Comprehensive security testing before push

```bash
# Example commit messages
git commit -m "feat(security): implement SQL injection detection engine"
git commit -m "fix(security): resolve false positive in XSS scanner"
git commit -m "test(security): add fuzzing tests for API endpoints"
```

#### 3. Security Testing
```bash
# Run security-specific tests
npm run test:security
npm run test:vulnerability-detection
npm run test:fuzzing

# Local security scanning
npm run scan:security-local
```

#### 4. Submit Pull Request
- **Title**: Clear security focus (e.g., "Security Plugin: Advanced SQL Injection Scanner")
- **Description**: Security implications and testing performed
- **Documentation**: Update security plugin documentation

### Automated Security Checks
Every contribution undergoes:
- **SAST Scanning**: Static Application Security Testing
- **Dependency Check**: Vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Plugin Validation**: Security plugin compatibility testing
- **Fuzzing Tests**: Basic fuzzing validation
- **Code Review**: Security-focused peer review
